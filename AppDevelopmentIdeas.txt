We want an app which is able to do the following:
  - Implement our Computer Vision Program
  - Take a picture

Two possible mode:
  - "Game" mode => gives user a specific character to draw and the user has to draw
  - "Search" mode => user asks for a specific word and app shows how to draw it and which one to draw
 
We will use:
  - xcode (helps create the app)
